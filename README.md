# Password Generator
This application lets the user make choices about the characteristics of their password and generates a random password based on those user inputs. 

## Installation
No installation is necessary. The application can be accessed through this url in any web browser: https://killingsworth-kristen.github.io/password-generator/.

## Usage
Click the "generate password" button and pop-ups will prompt you to make various choices about your password criteria. You can set the password length between 8-128 characters in length. If you put a value that does not fit those parameters, you will get an error message and be prompted to put in a valid value. Afterwards you can make decisions about what kinds of characters you want in your password generation including lowercase letter, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters/symbols (i.e. !, @, etc.). If you select no on all of the options an error message wil pop-up indicating that you have to select ok on at least one of the options. After your choices have been made the password generated will be displayed in the box on the screen.
